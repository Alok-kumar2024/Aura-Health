# AuraHealth

AuraHealth is an AI-powered dietary guardian that bridges the gap between a patient's prescription and their plate. Unlike static lists or basic search tools, AuraHealth uses a Knowledge Graph to understand the biochemical reasons behind interactions, ensuring no risk goes undetected.


## 🚀 Key Features



### 1. **Ingredient-Level Food Detection**
*  Unlike calorie trackers, AuraHealth identifies specific ingredients (e.g., spinach, grapefruit) that can affect drug behavior in the body.
  ### 2. **Educational Explanations**
*  Users receive short, easy-to-understand explanations of why a food is risky, improving long-term medication adherence.
### 3. **Data Source & Authenticity**
*  For drug–food interactions, we rely on information inspired by DrugBank, a well-known and widely used pharmaceutical database referenced by researchers, clinicians, and healthcare institutions around the world.


### 4. **EHR-Compatible Architecture**
 * Designed to integrate with existing Electronic Health Records, enabling future clinical and hospital adoption

### 5. **Mobile-First, Responsive Design**
* Designed to work smoothly across devices, making it suitable for daily use in real-world settings.
### 6. **Context-Aware Suggestions**
* When a risky interaction is detected, the UI dynamically displays safer food alternatives and short explanations tailored to the user’s medication.
